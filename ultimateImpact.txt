Apple first debuted homegrown semiconductors in the iPhone 4 in 2010. As of this year, all new Mac computers are powered by Apple\'s own silicon, ending the company\'s 15-plus years of reliance on Intel. "One of the most, if not the most, profound change at Apple, certainly in our products over the last 20 years, is how we now do so many of those technologies in-house," said John Ternus, who runs hardware engineering at Apple. "And top of the list, of course, is our silicon." That change has also opene', 'POSITIVE'), ("d Apple up to a new set of risks. Its most advanced silicon is primarily manufactured by one vendor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Meanwhile, smartphones are recovering from a deep sales slump, and competitors like Microsoft are making big leaps in artificial intelligence.

We got a rare chance to talk with the head of Apple silicon, Johny Srouji, about", 'POSITIVE'), (' the company\'s push into the complex business of custom semiconductor development, which is also being pursued by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla. "We have thousands of engineers," Srouji said. "But if you look at the portfolio of chips we do: very lean, actually. Very efficient." Unlike traditional chipmakers, Apple is not making silicon for other companies. "Because we\'re not really selling chips outside, we focus on the product," Srouji said. "That gives us freedom to optimize, and the scalable archi', 'POSITIVE'), ('tecture lets us reuse pieces between different products." Srouji came to Apple in 2008 to lead a small team of 40 or 50 engineers designing custom chips for the iPhone. A month after he joined, Apple bought P.A. Semiconductor, a 150-person startup, for $278 million. "They\'re going to start doing their own chips: that was the immediate takeaway when they bought P.A. Semi," said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. With its "inherent design focus," Bajarin said, Apple wants "to contr', 'NEGATIVE'), ('ol as much of the stack" as possible. Two years after the acquisition, Apple launched its first custom chip, the A4, in the iPhone 4 and original iPad. "We built what we call the unified memory architecture that is scalable across products," Srouji said. "We built an architecture that you start with the iPhone, but then we scaled it to the iPad and then to the watch and eventually to the Mac." Apple\'s silicon team has grown to thousands of engineers working across labs all over the world, including in Israe', 'POSITIVE'), ('l, Germany, Austria, the U.K. and Japan. Within the U.S., the company has facilities in Silicon Valley, San Diego and Austin, Texas. The primary type of chip Apple is developing is known as a system on a chip, or SoC. That brings together the central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU) and other components, Bajarin explained, adding that for Apple there\'s also a neural processing unit (NPU) "that runs the neural engine." "It is the silicon and all of the blocks that go on to that silicon,"', 'POSITIVE'), (" Bajarin said. Apple's first SoC was the A series, which has advanced from the A4 in 2010 to the A17 Pro announced in September of this year. It's the central processor in iPhones, as well as some iPads, Apple TVs and the HomePod. Apple's other major SoC is the M series, first released in 2020, which now powers all new Macs and more advanced iPads. That product is up to the M3 line. Launched in 2015, the S series is a smaller system in package, or SiP, for Apple Watch. H and W chips are used in AirPods. U c", 'NEGATIVE'), ('hips allow communication between Apple devices. And the newest chip, the R1, is set to ship early next year in Apple\'s Vision Pro headset. Dedicated to processing input from the device\'s cameras, sensors and microphones, Apple says it will stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds. "We get to design the chips ahead of time," Srouji said. He added that his staffers work with Ternus\'s team "to exactly and precisely build chips that are going to be targeted for those products, and only for those pro', 'POSITIVE'), ('ducts." The H2 inside the 2nd generation AirPods Pro, for instance, enables better noise cancellation. Inside the new Series 9 Apple Watch, the S9 allows for unusual capabilities like double tap. In iPhones, the A11 Bionic in 2017 had the first Apple Neural Engine, a dedicated part of the SoC for performing AI tasks totally on-device. The latest A17 Pro announced in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max in September enables major leaps in features like computational photography and advanced rendering for gaming. "I', 'POSITIVE'), ('t was actually the biggest redesign in GPU architecture and Apple silicon history," said Kaiann Drance, who leads marketing for the iPhone. "We have hardware accelerated ray tracing for the first time. And we have mesh shading acceleration, which allows game developers to create some really stunning visual effects." That\'s led to the development of iPhone-native versions from Ubisoft\'s Assassin\'s Creed Mirage, The Division Resurgence and Capcom\'s Resident Evil 4.\xa0\xa0 Apple says the A17 Pro is the first 3-nano', 'POSITIVE'), ('meter chip to ship at high volume. "The reason we use 3-nanometer is it gives us the ability to pack more transistors in a given dimension. That is important for the product and much better power efficiency," Srouji said. "Even though we\'re not a chip company, we are leading the industry for a reason." Apple\'s leap to 3-nanometer continued with the M3 chips for Mac computers, announced in October. Apple says the M3 enables features like 22-hour battery life and, similar to the A17 Pro, boosted graphics perf', 'POSITIVE'), ('ormance. "It\'s early days," said Ternus, who\'s been at Apple for 22 years.\xa0"We have a lot of work to do, but I think there\'s so many Macs now, pretty much all Macs are capable of running Triple-A titles, which is not what it was like five years ago." Ternus said that when he started, "the way we tended to make products is we were using technologies from other companies, and we were effectively building the product around that." Despite a focus on beautiful design, "they were constrained by what was availabl', 'NEGATIVE'), ('e," he said. In a major shift for the semiconductor industry, Apple turned away from using Intel\'s PC processors in 2020, switching to its own M1 chip inside the MacBook Air and other Macs. "It was almost like the laws of physics had changed," Ternus said. "All of a sudden we could build a MacBook Air that\'s incredibly thin and light, has no fan, 18 hours of battery life, and outperformed the MacBook Pro that we had just been shipping." He said the newest MacBook Pro with Apple\'s most advanced chip, the M3 ', 'NEGATIVE'), ('Max, "is 11 times faster than the fastest Intel MacBook Pro we were making. And we were shipping that just two years ago." Intel processors are based on x86 architecture, the traditional choice for PC makers, with a lot of software developed for it. Apple bases its processors on rival Arm architecture, known for using less power and helping laptop batteries last longer. Apple\'s M1 in 2020 was a proving point for Arm-based processors in high-end computers, with other big names like Qualcomm — and reportedly ', 'NEGATIVE'), ('AMD and Nvidia — also developing Arm-based PC processors. In September, Apple extended its deal with Arm through at least 2040.\xa0 When its first custom chip came out 13 years ago, Apple was unusual as a non-chip company trying to make it in the cutthroat, cost-prohibitive semiconductor market. Since then, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla have tried their hand at custom chips. "Apple was sort of the trailblazer," said Stacy Rasgon, managing director and senior analyst at Bernstein Research. "They sort of s', 'NEGATIVE'), ('howed that if you do this, you can have a stab at differentiating your products." Apple isn\'t yet making every piece of silicon in its devices. Modems, for example, are one big component the company has yet to conquer on its own. "The processors have been remarkably good. Where they\'ve struggled is on the modem side, is on the radio side in the phones," Rasgon said. "Modems are hard." Apple relies on Qualcomm for its modems, although in 2019, the two companies settled a two-year legal battle over intellectu', 'NEGATIVE'), ('al property. Soon after, Apple bought the majority of Intel\'s 5G modem business for $1 billion, in a likely move to develop its own cellular modem. That hasn\'t happened yet, and in September, Apple signed on with Qualcomm to supply its modems through 2026. "Qualcomm still makes the best modems in the world," Bajarin said. "Until Apple can do as good of a job, I have a hard time seeing them fully jump to that." Apple\'s Srouji said he couldn\'t comment on "future technologies and products" but said "we care ab', 'POSITIVE'), ('out cellular, and we have teams enabling that." Apple is also\xa0reportedly working on\xa0its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip. For now, it has a\xa0fresh multibillion-dollar deal with Broadcom\xa0for wireless components. Apple relies on third parties like Samsung and Micron for memory. "Our aspiration is the product," Srouji said, when asked if Apple will try to design every part of its chips. "We want to build the best products on the planet. As a technology team, which also includes the chips in this case, we want to bu', 'POSITIVE'), ('ild the best technology that would enable that vision." To deliver on that objective, Apple will "buy off the shelf" if it means the team can focus "on what really, really matters," Srouji said. Regardless of how much silicon Apple eventually designs, it still needs to manufacture its chips externally. That requires massive fabrication plants owned by foundry companies like TSMC. More than 90% of the world\'s advanced chips are made by TSMC in Taiwan, which leaves Apple and the rest of the industry vulnerabl', 'NEGATIVE'), ('e to the China threat of invasion. "There is obviously a lot of tension around, like, what would plan B be if that happened?" Bajarin said. "There isn\'t another good option. You would hope that Samsung is also competitive and Intel wants to be there. But again, we\'re not right now. It\'s really all at TSMC." Apple is at least looking to bring some of that manufacturing to the U.S. It\'s committed to becoming the largest customer at TSMC\'s coming fab in Arizona. And on Thursday Apple announced it will be the f', 'NEGATIVE'), ('irst and largest customer of the new $2 billion Amkor manufacturing and packaging facility being built in Peoria, Arizona. Amkor will package Apple silicon produced at TSMC\'s Arizona fab. "We always want to have a diversified supply: Asia, Europe and the U.S., which is why I think TSMC building fabs in Arizona is great," Srouji said. Another concern is the shortage of skilled chip labor in the U.S., where advanced fabs haven\'t been built for decades. TSMC says its Arizona fab is now delayed to 2025 because ', 'POSITIVE'), ('of a lack of skilled workers. Whether or not it has to do with a shortage of talent, Apple has seen a slowdown in the release of new chips. "Generations are taking longer because they are getting harder and harder," Srouji said. "And the ability to pack more and get power efficiency is also different than 10 years ago." Srouji reiterated his view that Apple has an advantage in that regard because "I don\'t need to worry about where do I send my chips, how do I target a larger customer base?" Still, Apple\'s a', 'NEGATIVE'), ('ctions underscore the competitiveness in the market. In 2019, Apple chip architect Gerard Williams left to lead a data center chip startup called Nuvia, bringing some Apple engineers with him. Apple sued Williams over IP concerns, before dropping the case this year. Qualcomm bought Nuvia in 2021, in a move to compete in Arm-based PC processors like Apple\'s. "I can\'t really discuss legal matters, but we truly care about IP protection," Srouji said. "When certain people leave for certain reasons, that\'s their', 'POSITIVE'), (' choice." Apple has additional macro challenges in its core business because smartphone sales are just recovering from their lowest levels in years. However, demand for AI workloads is leading to a surge in orders for silicon, especially for GPUs made by companies like Nvidia, whose stock has jumped more than 200% this year tied to the popularity of ChatGPT and other generative AI services. Google has designed a tensor processing unit for AI since 2016.\xa0Amazon Web Services has had its own AI chips for the d', 'NEGATIVE'), ('ata center since 2018. Microsoft released its new AI chip in November. Srouji said his team at Apple has been working on its machine learning engines, the Apple Neural Engine, since years before it was launched in the A11 Bionic chip in 2017. He also pointed to embedded machine learning accelerators in its CPU and "highly optimized GPU for machine learning." Apple\'s Neural Engines power what it calls "on-device machine learning features" like Face ID and Animojis. In July, Bloomberg reported that Apple buil', 'POSITIVE'), ('t its own large language model called Ajax and a chatbot called Apple GPT. A spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the accuracy of the report. Apple has also acquired more than two dozen AI companies since 2015. When asked if Apple appears to be falling behind in AI, Srouji said, "I don\'t believe we are." Bajarin is more skeptical. "It\'s doable on Apple\'s last year chip, even more capable on this year\'s chip with M3," Bajarin said, regarding Apple\'s position in AI. "But the software has got to catch up w', 'NEGATIVE'), ('ith that, so that developers take advantage and write tomorrow\'s AI software on Apple Silicon." He anticipates improvements, and soon.

Other benefits include mitigating the inter-engine context-transfer overhead and opening up the CPU ', 'POSITIVE'), ('and the GPU to execute non-ML workloads while ANE is executing the most demanding ML workloads. In this section, we describe some of the generalizable principles behind our reference implementation for Transformers with the goal of empowering developers to optimize models they intend to deploy on the ANE.

The final piece is figuring out how to get the supplies from the landing location to the agencies that need it, which means working with local partners who ha', 'NEGATIVE'), ('ve that capability.  The story of how a plane full of badly needed supplies arrived in the Bahamas on Monday, September 16, starts with Bettina Stix, senior manager of community engagement at Amazon, who was already a veteran Amazon employee when a devastating Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia in December of 2004. She watched as some of Amazon’s software engineers figured out how to create a donate button on the Amazon.com website that customers could use to send cash to help relief efforts.', 'NEGATIVE'), (' The donation project quickly became an international initiative within Amazon that raised $15 million to help the Red Cross serve victims of the tsunami. “That left an impression,” Stix remembered. “It left the impression that there are many more ways to make a difference than being search and rescue. I thought, ‘We can do so much more than just collecting cash. We could put our logistics and our technology to use.’” She wrote a “Working Backwards” document. That’s a process Amazon uses to ensure a project', 'NEGATIVE'), (' begins with the customer in mind first – from envisioning how to delight or serve customers, then clarifying the idea through an imagined press release and by answering a set of frequently asked questions about the proposal. Stix envisioned a program that would leverage Amazon’s capabilities around the world to provide relief supplies to first-responder partners. The prospect generated widespread enthusiasm among Amazon staff, and soon leadership had given Stix the green light to recruit a few other Amazon', 'POSITIVE'), (' employees for a Disaster Relief by Amazon team. Almost as soon as the group was in place in 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused massive flooding in Houston, sending people scrambling to their rooftops to await rescue as waters rose. The Red Cross had set up a shelter in the city’s George Brown Convention Center, and Amazon sent its first truck into the disaster zone with snacks and water for those congregated there. The Coast Guard and others who were rescuing people in boats needed supplies as well, and the dis', 'NEGATIVE'), ('aster relief team arranged for them to pick up donated life vests from Amazon’s fulfillment center in Dallas. The idea that Stix presented in her working backwards document had come to life. Amazon, its employees, and its customers have donated products and cash equal to more than $15 million to help with 25 disasters around the world. In the first half of 2019 alone, the company distributed more than 400,000 relief items to the communities affected by several natural disasters and storm events: cyclones in', 'POSITIVE'), (' Indonesia and Mozambique, snowstorms in Seattle, tornadoes in Georgia and Alabama, and flooding in Ottawa, Canada.   The Disaster Relief by Amazon team also sends people into the field to establish temporary pick-up locations that Amazon can set up quickly in areas where the company’s usual delivery services have been suspended. When Florence hit, a “Go Team” headed for the disaster area and the first such spot in a North Carolina Whole Foods Market parking lot. Amazon’s website directed customers in given', 'POSITIVE'), (' ZIP codes to pick up their orders at the location. What the Go Team hadn’t anticipated was how useful the location would become for the emergency responders—both organizations that needed a place to receive supply shipments and out-of-town volunteers in search of various items. “Our first customer during Florence was a Red Cross volunteer who needed a hammer and another set of tools,” recalled Ash Brown, the Rocky Mountain regional operations manager for Amazon Hub and Locker+ and the leader of the team of', 'NEGATIVE'), (' volunteers that set up the first pop-up location. “Our second customer was from FEMA, needing a resupply of specialized clothing. We didn’t expect how useful our presence on the ground would be to these other customers.” The team plans to replicate the pop-up pick-up location where possible in the wake of future disasters.   The nature and scale of Amazon’s relief efforts reflect the company’s unique capabilities as a global distributor of an extensive range of items. “We can help with items that many othe', 'POSITIVE'), ('r donors can’t provide,” said Stix. For example, after wildfires ravaged homes In Northern California, Amazon was able to fulfill relief agencies’ request for Goldrush Sifters—mini sieves to help people find valuables among the ashes. The ability to satisfy real needs in specific ways comes back to working in deep partnership with relief organizations in order to complement and support, rather than preempt or replicating their work. “The way we partner with Amazon makes the best use of each of our competenc', 'POSITIVE'), ('ies with an end result of helping the most people possible,” said Jeanne-Aimee De Marrais, senior advisor on U.S. emergencies for Save the Children. Her colleague Dawn Nunn, director of gift-in-kind agrees: “Amazon’s ability to move quickly and with agility to solve business problems has been a huge benefit of working together. They have helped us develop and expand our in-kind strategies using their core competencies of speed, reach, and superior logistics systems.” For the Hurricane Dorian response, Amazo', 'POSITIVE'), ('n and customers across the United States donated cash and more than 400,000 relief items worth $1 million.

We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers.

We use increasingly advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict which items customers in various', 'POSITIVE'), (' parts of the country will want and when they will want them, and we work with our vendors and selling partners to store those products closer to customers. This helps to ensure that we have the right inventory, in the right places, at the right time. We’re also expanding our capacity to place products in the right fulfillment center in each region.

Same-Day facilities are smaller buildings situated close to the large metro areas they serve, which decreases the distance to customers. I’ve spent a lot of time in these buildings this year, and I can personally attest to the innovation and customer obsession happening in them every day.

And with conne', 'POSITIVE'), ('ctions to the larger Amazon fulfillment centers nearby, we dramatically increase the number of items available for fast delivery. Same-Day Delivery is currently available on millions of items for customers across more than 90 U.S. metro areas, and we have plans to double the number of sites in the coming years.

Lowering costs drives a better customer experience, because the lower our cost to serve customers gets, the more products our vendors and selling p', 'NEGATIVE'), ('artners can make available in our store—meaning our selection keeps getting better for customers. We are delivering faster speeds on a broader selection while also improving the overall safety of our employees. It’s easy to assume the faster we deliver, the faster employees work—but that couldn’t be further from the truth. The speed improvements we’re making come primarily from placing products closer to customers.

What’s changed is the product is traveling fewer miles and experiencing fewer handoffs between the time you place an order and the time it gets to your door.

Over two years, $72.5 billion on buybacks, 33.6 billion of that in Q3 and Q4 of 2021 and your average buyback price, $389.74.

Those are tough decisions. But to your point, we're not seeing that at AMD. Tim Beyers: We're not, and to be fair to Intel, part of that is because Intel has taken on a project that AMD has not and really cannot. Intel is going to be in the business of reshoring chip manufacturing here in the United States. They're not only competing with AMD, they're competing with Taiwan Semiconductor.

That said, we seem to have entered an economic downturn that will have a broad impact on the digital advertising business.

In this environment, we're focused on making the long-term investments that will position us to be stronger coming out of th", 'POSITIVE'), ("is downturn, including our work on our discovery engine and Reels, our new ads infrastructure and the metaverse. And we're also focused on being rigorous about measuring returns and sizing these investments correctly. Now on our last call, I discussed that based on the revenue growth we were seeing in 2021, we kicked off a number of multiyear projects to accelerate our business. And I still believe that these projects are important. But given the more recent revenue trajectory that we're seeing, we are slow", 'NEGATIVE'), ('ing the pace of these investments and pushing some expenses that would have come in the next year or two off to a somewhat longer time line.

And I want to give our leaders the ability to decide within their teams where to double down, where to backfill attrition a', 'POSITIVE'), ("nd where to restructure teams while minimizing thrash to the long-term initiatives. The fact that we hired a lot of people earlier this year means that our reported year-over-year headcount growth will still be substantial for the next few quarters, but it should continue to decline over time. Now this is a period that demands more intensity, and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources. We're currently going through the process of increasing the goals for many of our efforts. Previously challengin", 'NEGATIVE'), ("g periods have been transformational for our company and helped us develop our next generation of leaders. And I expect this period to be no different. I expect that we're going to find a way to keep investing in our top priority areas. And I think we're going to come through this period as a stronger and more disciplined organization. Now next, I want to discuss how we're doing in our high-priority areas. To understand where we're going, it's important to keep in mind that there are two major technological", 'POSITIVE'), (" waves that we're riding in our business. The first wave of driving our business today is AI, and then the second longer-term wave is the emergence of the metaverse. One of the main transformations in our business right now is that social feeds are going from being driven primarily by the people and accounts you follow to increasingly also being driven by AI recommending content that you'll find interesting from across Facebook or Instagram, even if you don't follow those creators. Social content from peopl", 'POSITIVE'), ("e you know is going to remain an important part of the experience and some of our most differentiated content. But increasingly, we'll also be able to supplement that with other interesting content from across our networks. Reels is one part of this trend that focuses on the growth of short-form video as a content format. But this overall AI trend is much broader and covers all types of content, including text, images, links, group content and more. And building a recommendation system across all these type", 'POSITIVE'), ("s of content is something that we're uniquely focused on. Right now, about 15% of content in a person's Facebook feed and a little more than that of their Instagram feed is recommended by our AI, from people, groups, or accounts that you don't follow. And we expect these numbers to more than double by the end of next year. As our AI finds additional content that people will find interesting, that increases engagement and the quality of our feeds. And since we're already efficient in monetizing most of these", 'POSITIVE'), (' formats, this should increase our business opportunity over that period as well. Reels engagement is also growing quickly. I shared last quarter that Reels already made up 20% of the time that people spend on Instagram. This quarter, we saw a more than 30% increase in the time that people spent engaging with Reels across Facebook and Instagram. AI advances are driving a lot of these improvements. And one example is that after launching a new large AI model for recommendations, we saw a 15% increase in watc', 'POSITIVE'), ("h time in the Reels video player on Facebook alone. So I think that there are many improvements like this that we're going to be able to continue to make. As we are building out our discovery engine though, I want to be clear that we are still ultimately a social company focused on helping people connect. One social trend that we're seeing is that instead of people just interacting in comments in their feeds, most people find interesting content in their feeds then they message -- and then they message that", 'POSITIVE'), (" content to friends and interact here. And this creates this flywheel of discovery and then social connection and then inspiring those people to create more content themselves. In Instagram, for example, we see that Reels makes up more than half of content reshared into messages. So our strategy isn't about public versus social content and interaction. It's really about enabling a flywheel that compounds both. All right. Next on to Ads. We faced a number of challenges here in the near term, but the investme", 'POSITIVE'), ("nts that we're making should give us a comparative advantage over the longer term. One near-term challenge is the growth of short-form video. Reels doesn't yet monetize at the same rate as Feed or Stories. So in the near term, the faster that Reels grows, the more revenue that actually displaces from higher monetizing surfaces. Now in theory, we could mitigate the short-term headwind by pushing less hard on growing Reels, but that would be worse for our products and business longer term since we're confiden", 'NEGATIVE'), ("t that Reels will grow engagement overall and quality and will eventually monetize closer to Feed. Our work on ads monetization efficiency for Reels is actually making faster progress than we'd expected. We've now crossed a $1 billion annual revenue run rate for Reels ads, and Reels also has a higher revenue run rate than Stories did at identical times post-launch. So the bottom line is I think we're on track here and we just need to push through this one. The second challenge that we face here is the signa", 'NEGATIVE'), ("l loss from Apple's iOS changes. And as I've discussed before, our approach here is to grow first-party understanding of people's interests by making it easier for people to engage with businesses in our own apps, whether that's through business messaging, shops or new ad products. For example, click to messaging as part of our business messaging strategy that's grown quickly with 40% of our advertisers already using this format. The AI wave that we are riding is a tailwind for all of these solutions. Advan", 'NEGATIVE'), ("ces in AI enable us to deliver better-personalized ads while using less data.

Now overall, there's a lot of work to do here and a lot of the investment is in AI compute capex. But I'm confident that if we invest in building the new infrastructure that we need", 'POSITIVE'), (", then we're going to come out of this downturn with even more superior ad products and a meaningful technology advantage over other industry players. Now of course, the third challenge that we're facing here is the macro economy. And we can't control the timing of when things will bounce back, but I'll note that periods like this are when marketers reevaluate their budgets and are even more focused on finding the highest-performing advertising. And in the last recession, we invested in our ads business thr", 'POSITIVE'), ("ough the downturn and came out stronger on the other side, and I'm focused on making sure that we do the same today. Now if AI is the major technological wave that we're riding today, then the last priority that I want to discuss is about the Metaverse technological wave that is currently building. And the Metaverse is a massive opportunity for a number of reasons. Most importantly, it enables deeper social experiences, where you feel a realistic sense of presence with other people, no matter where they are", 'POSITIVE'), (". Whether you're playing games or working for hours at a time or if you're just jumping in for just a minute at a time to say hi to a friend or collaborate on a project quickly. By helping to develop these platforms, we're going to have the freedom to build these experiences the way that we and the overall industry believe will be best rather than being limited by the constraints that competitors place on us and on our community and on small businesses. And given some of the product and business constraints", 'POSITIVE'), (" that we face now, I feel even more strongly now that developing these platforms will unlock hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions over time. This is obviously a very expensive undertaking over the next several years. But as the metaverse becomes more important in every part of how we live from our social platforms and entertainment to work and education and commerce, I'm confident that we're going to be glad that we played an important role in building this. The next milestones to look out for ", 'POSITIVE'), ("here are the continued expansion of Horizon, our social metaverse platform, and the continued improvement of our Avatars platform, how you express yourself and interact in the metaverse as well as the commerce around that.

This is just one milestone in the long-term path, but I think people are go", 'POSITIVE'), ("ing to be pretty blown away by this. All right. So those are the areas that I'm most focused on right now and that I think are going to have the greatest impact on our products and business over the next few years and much longer. Periods like this can be tough, but I really think that the additional focus and discipline are going to make us stronger over time. Now in addition to our business, this is also a period of transition for our leadership team.

Are you seeing any dollars or advertisers pull that could be moving over there for maybe lower CPMs? Any th", 'POSITIVE'), ("oughts on competitive headwinds? And then second, just a quick question on guidance. Is there contemplated pressure on quarter revenue in 3Q versus 2Q because of the Reel usage increases? Sheryl Sandberg -- Chief Operating Officer I'll take the first question. We exist in a really competitive advertising market where advertisers have broad opportunities to advertise both offline and online and there are almost endless options. So we know we have to earn our share and continue to deliver great ROI and be abl", 'NEGATIVE'), ("e to measure results. And that's why we're focused on the continual product improvements that we talk about in these calls quarter over quarter and we'll continue to do going forward. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer And, Justin, let me make sure I got that question. I think you were asking about Q3 and just pressure on Q3 because of Reels usage. Mark mentioned that we are really excited that the run rate on Reels crossed $1 billion, but it is overall because engagement is shifting to Reels. It is an ", 'POSITIVE'), ("overall headwind on the business. We haven't specifically quantified that, but there is a headwind on the business as Reels grows. In the long run, we, of course, believe that this will be a tailwind on revenue but that's not happening in 2022. We're optimistic that it can be in the long run. But in general, the pressure that we're seeing on Q3 is overwhelmingly a macro one, where we're seeing sort of broad-based weakness across most of the verticals. Operator Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Go", 'NEGATIVE'), ('ldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thanks so much for taking the questions. Two, if I could. One, in terms of honing the focus on investments inside the company and reexamining the cost side. How should we think about the mix between Reality Labs and Family of Apps and what the impact might be on relative margin structure of the two segments as you hone the cost structure of the company and think about that investment cycle in both areas of the business? That would be nu', 'POSITIVE'), ("mber one. And number two, maybe just following up on Justin's question and broadening out a little bit. Is there any way to unpack some of the impact of macro, which is clearly outrunning some of the easier comps you'll be facing in Q3. Because we're lapping IDFA from a year ago, there was an easier comp on top of just IDFA and yet implied is that the rate of growth continues to sort of weaken in Q3 versus Q2. So maybe unpacking a little bit some of the headwinds versus tailwinds in Q3 to Q2 would be helpfu", 'NEGATIVE'), ("l. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, Eric, I can take those. And again, if anybody has color, they can add. On the investment focus, I would say broad-based, we're really focusing the investments that the company is making on the key priorities. Now one of those key priorities is clearly the effort that we have behind the Metaverse and Reality Labs. So it remains an area in which we are going to be increasing investment. But we do plan to have discipline across the entire operating posture of the ", 'POSITIVE'), ("company. When looking at the Q3 comps, I think you're making an important point. As we headed into the back half of this year, we do get the benefit in our year-over-year growth rates from lapping the Apple iOS rollout, which happened -- was largely complete by Q3 and Q4 of last year. So we're getting the benefit of more favorable comps on the signals headwind. But that is being offset by the macro environment and the challenges we're seeing there. Now, of course, there are some hard-to-unpack factors. That", 'POSITIVE'), (" is at the first order, but of course, we're seeing just generally challenging environment for digital advertising. And there's several compounding factors. Of course, there's just the overall economic uncertainty that's reflected in the markets. There is the fact that we're lapping periods in which there was still a benefit from COVID in some of the sectors that are important to us, like e-commerce. And then finally, just the signals headwinds and the challenges that advertisers are facing on a second orde", 'NEGATIVE'), ("r basis may be affecting some spend. But at least on the first order, we think it's largely a macro environment that is offsetting the benefit that we would otherwise be getting from lapping the iOS 14 rollout last year. Operator Our next question is from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Mark Shmulik -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst Yes. Hi. Two questions, if I may. The first remark, back to the discovery engine pivot, certainly a big change for the platform and certainly understand users' hesit", 'POSITIVE'), ("ancy on kind of any changes. But beyond the flywheel effect of sharing, any more color you can share on kind of what would differentiate the discovery platform here on Facebook and Instagram versus some other platforms would be much appreciated. And then secondly, on the buyback cadence, is there any right way to think about that? I know the buybacks kind of went down a little bit this quarter. And I've also noticed it kind of seems to trend along with free cash flow generation. Is that the right way to thi", 'NEGATIVE'), ("nk about the buyback strategy going forward? Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer You want to take buybacks and then I'll take the product question? Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Do you want to go first? I can do buybacks first. So thanks, Mark. Obviously, we look at a lot of factors when it comes to our buyback program. We are -- we still have a substantial amount remaining in the buyback program and then we expect to continue to have buybacks as part of our capital allocation strategy ", 'POSITIVE'), ("going forward. So no real change in posture to announce there. We'll continue to be looking at capital return opportunities over time. Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer Great. Yes. And on the discovery engine thing, there are a few different pieces of context that I think are important here. One is social content from the people you know is going to continue being very important. And obviously, following people is an important signal. If you go back 10 years ago, the AI to basically figure out what", 'NEGATIVE'), (" types of things you were interested in other than having a signal of what you directly follow didn't really exist. It wasn't good enough. So who you followed or who you're friends with was this sort of amazing signal. And it was more unique in a way, whereas now increasingly, AI is able to identify things that you're interested in that might be from accounts that you're not following or might even be whole topics that you're not following anyone in that topic. And that just unlocks a bigger corpus of conte", 'POSITIVE'), ("nt that you're going to be interested in. So the social parts of what we do will always remain. I think that that will be a very kind of differentiated and important part of what we're doing. On the discovery engine piece, I do think that we're seeing a different approach than some competitors in that we have a lot of different types of content formats. So I talked about this a little bit upfront in my opening remarks. But the AI that we're building here, it doesn't just apply to videos or it's certainly no", 'POSITIVE'), ("t just short-form video. It also works with text and links and photos and content and groups and discussions on comments and all of these different things. And actually, one of the really fascinating AI problems is to produce just like basically a very large model. The AI researchers call it an embedding that's basically trying to unpack basically like meaning or semantics or kind of what a post is about into this very high-dimensional mathematical space. But that can work across all different content types", 'NEGATIVE'), (". And being able to do that well, I think we'll end up producing a different experience on Facebook and Instagram compared to some of our other competitors that are just focused on one content format. And I think in that sense, what we're doing is going to be pretty unique and is going to create a lot of value. I don't think people are going to want to be constrained to just one format. And I certainly think that people are going to always continue caring about what's going on with their friends and family ", 'POSITIVE'), ("and people they know as well. So this is all going to be kind of a growing thing that makes it so there's more interesting content available. And basically, it makes the service more -- just better for people to engage with and other things. And then part of the business challenge is just we need to make sure we can monetize Reels well. Like I said in my opening remarks, that's sort of on track but less than the rest of Feed today, but we're optimistic that we'll get it there. So that way, as this ends up i", 'NEGATIVE'), ("ncreasing the overall engagement on the platform, it will also end up being a tailwind for the business, too.

And do you expect that over time, you'll ", 'NEGATIVE'), ("ever be able to return to the levels of targeting and measurement from before the platform changes?

But I don't know exactly which one we are. But I will say that we're really -- I think we're pretty early on this. I think in many ways, we use data very effectively and in a very privacy-safe way all along to build out very measurable results and very measurable personalized targeting for advertisers. And I think we led there. And now we're in a new era where we have to do that same form of targeting, that same form ", 'POSITIVE'), ("of measurement using less data. And I think it's pretty early days in our ability to do that. We're going to do it by investing on our own, investing in AI, investing in machine learning. We're going to do it in rolling out products, like we have recently, that help us and advertisers measure where we're sharing less data between, as I talked about in my remarks. But we're also going to do it with our industry because it's worth noting that this is not a challenge we face alone. This is a challenge that any", 'POSITIVE'), ("one that's running on the Apple iOS platform has. And the industry is working together, I think, pretty collaboratively in -- not every player, but in a lot of players, many ways to get solutions. Dave Wehner -- Chief Financial Officer Doug, I just wanted to first kind of hit the premise of the question, which is if we continue to see macroeconomic challenges. It's just historically, macroeconomic challenges are often linked to some sort of cyclical effects. And we do know there's lots of things going on in", 'POSITIVE'), (" the broader economy that point in that direction, including rate hikes and the like. So we do think there is a cyclical component of this. We know that advertising can be especially subject to these cyclical pressures. We do think that long term, digital within advertising continues to have a very positive future. And we think that we are positioned to continue to grow engagement nicely and build the best products in digital in the market. So we're quite confident that as the market conditions improve, we'", 'POSITIVE'), ("ll continue to be able to return to nice levels of growth.

So we'll continue to monitor that as we go into future budget and planning cycles. Operator Our next question is from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Thanks. I have two, maybe one for Sheryl and one for Mark. Sheryl, I'm inter", 'POSITIVE'), ("ested in this juxtaposition position that Reels grew faster than Stories did. You reached $1 billion. Yet at the same time, you're saying that it's a harder business to monetize. So what drove -- why do you think the adoption was faster? And then in terms of the sticking points, when you talk to advertisers, what are the things that they need to solve for in order to move money faster to Reels? And, Mark, I think going to one of the earlier questions about your advantages at Facebook. The previous moat, we ", 'NEGATIVE'), ("would argue, was just the social graph of billions of people, families, and friends. Do you think what you're building now with AI or from getting all this content is even -- is a better moat, is a better business than the one you had before, which was a pretty high barrier to entry, just given the social effects of the network you built.

On Reels, we have a playbook where we, I think, do a very good job buildi", 'NEGATIVE'), ("ng products that consumers love to use, and then building ad formats which match those products so they can integrate nicely into the consumer experience.

We know we need to give them measurable tools, and we've gotten better at selling the next product, a", 'NEGATIVE'), ("nd I think we'll continue to get better at that going forward.

So though we're proud of where we've gotten on a run rate basis, we're still very early in the trajectory of monetization", 'POSITIVE'), (". And we'll have to see we're able to do a great job of closing that gap with Stories. I think there's always unique features in each different format that make an exact analogy imperfect, but we're optimistic on our ability to at least get a good ways on that journey toward closing the gap. In terms of M&A, there's -- M&A is definitely a component of our strategy, and we'll continue to look at acquisitions going forward.

First for Mark, just curious as AI curation of content takes over from social cues, I was hoping you could talk about what some of the biggest changes will be to the user experience and", 'POSITIVE'), (' then perhaps monetization as well long term? And then second, in terms of Reels, how do you think about the timing for turning on ads more? And what needs to happen in the product for that to happen? Mark Zuckerberg -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. So I can talk about the AI-driven recommendations and discovery engine part.

On the Reels monetization side, I mean, I think the main question here is, there's the cycle, which -- I mean, Sheryl should pro", 'NEGATIVE'), ("bably jump in and talk a little bit more about this, is just take some time for all the advertisers to optimize the creative, right? It's like when we started doing Stories, they had ads that were designed for News Feed. And it just took some time for them to create effective content for stores.

I have two. First, Mark, on the regulatory front, it looks like European and U.S. regulators are getting more aligned on how to proceed to address issues like antitrust and interoperability, the news on the transatlantic data transfers seems pretty positive. Just stepping back and looking at the new environment that seems to be formed, particularly between European and U.S. regulators, d', 'POSITIVE'), ("o you see this as being more favorable or less favorable to Facebook?

Now is a really critical and interesting time in regulation for our industry because the rules that are governing the Internet are being rethought and rewritten, certainly ", 'POSITIVE'), ("in Europe but increasingly around the world. You spoke about the DMA. We expect DMA to have significant challenges for our industry. We're working with European regulators on these rules. They are largely in the range of what we were expecting, but the final text has not been released yet, and the details on this will matter.

Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- Analyst Thanks. I have one for Sheryl and one for Dave. Sheryl, in the past, you've been pretty clear that IDFA is a two-part problem, measurement and targeting.

So I don't know if I have a whole lot that's additive, but it now makes up a meaningful portion of people's time on Instagram. Mark gave the stat that it's over 20% of people's time on Instagram. So that speaks to there being a good opportunity as we ramp ads in Reels, but it's very early days in terms of ads in Reels. But that being said, it's going to take -- it's going to be, as Sheryl said, a multiyear journey. If you look at Stories, Stories, we really began ramping in 2018.", 'POSITIVE'), (" And at the end of last year, we mentioned that in developed markets, Stories on a sort of per time basis was monetizing at a similar rate as Feed. So it took many years for that gap to close and there's still work to be done across the world on that front.

Just one follow-up for Sheryl kind of related to that last question. So now that we're in this world where no one can use mobile IDs for targeting.

S", 'NEGATIVE'), ("heryl Sandberg -- Chief Operating Officer Sorry, Dave and I are going back and forth. When you think about how we mitigate some of these challenges, there's a couple of things to think about. One, what are the solutions we have that can be on site.

", 'NEGATIVE'), ("If our commerce efforts are successful over the longer term, we'll be able to close that loop directly on our end service. The other thing that was interesting, and your question is you're right that this is about relative comparative advantage in a very highly competitive space that we have been able to use data, I think, in a privacy safe but very efficiently. Some of the data we've relied on has changed that's causing some near-term challenges and headwinds for us. But over the long run, once that settle", 'POSITIVE'), ("s out, advertisers are going to go where they get the best return.

Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst I know it's early on Reels monetization, but are there early learnings that you've learned and taken away so far that you could share?

Now I'm confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term trade-off to make in order to get long-term gains. We've made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and Stories, where we took on headwinds in the near term to align with important trends over the long term.

It’s hard to pinpoint anyone’s maturation, but in looking at Zuckerberg, and the third Mark, you could do worse than to consider September 2021. Facebook stock had hit its all-time high.

Meta has already accumulated some $40 billion in opera-ting losses from its bet on the idea of an alternate virtual universe led by its Reality Labs arm, but Zuckerberg remains all-in.

Muskâ\x80\x99s last bonus award was supposed to cover the term from 2018 to 2028 and had a series of milestones that needed to be achieved during that period, several of which were tied to Teslaâ\x80\x99s market cap.

There is no clawback if the company performance and share price should fall back to below the targets, once the award is vested it remains vested, so Musk has no currently active incentive plan. The 2018 award consisted of 303,960,630 share options with a strike price of $23.34 and an expiry date of January 19th, 2028. Once exercised there is a five-year hold period preventing the sale of the shares, except that sufficient shares can be sold on exercise to pay the strike price and the assoc', 'NEGATIVE'), ('iated taxes. In addition to the bonus award stock options, Musk owns 411,062,076 shares in Tesla. If all his stock options were exercised, his shareholding would be 715,022,706, approximately 20.6% of the company. Any claim that Elon Musk is somehow not incentivized to manage Tesla is questionable because a $1 change in Teslaâ\x80\x99s share price results in a $715 million change in his pre-tax net worth. I think most reasonable shareholders would consider that to be a sufficient incentive. It seems that Musk may', 'NEGATIVE'), (" not be as concerned about the financial aspects of a new plan, as he is about maintaining control of Tesla. In a tweet this week, he put forward a case for additional incentive to increase his voting control to 25% of the company.

What I am looking at is the implications for Tesla shareholders of giving Elon Musk another incentive bonus that would increase his voting control to 25% of the company.

And for chief financial officers, AI offers them something invaluable: more time in their day. When used to automate repetitive and manual tasks, such as data entry and invoice processing, AI can open up opportunities for finance leaders to focus on financial planning, analysis, and more strategic work, said Joseph Wolk,\xa0executive vice president and CFO at Johnson & Johnson. In a conversation with MIT Sloan economist\xa0Simon Johnso', 'POSITIVE'), ('n\xa0at the 21st annual MIT Sloan CFO Summit, Wolk said that AI is poised to “free up time for people in the finance function to be better influencers of decisions.” “At Johnson & Johnson, and in the finance function specifically, we have a little mantra: We’re business leaders with a finance expertise,” Wolk said. “The finance expertise is secondary to helping the business solve problems.” Regarding the ways in which AI has swiftly gained worldwide acceptance, Johnson attributed AI’s adoption to its “fun elem', 'POSITIVE'), ('ent” and existing infrastructure. “We’ve already built digital rails that can distribute this product instantly everywhere,” Johnson said. “You might need to scale up a few things in terms of bandwidth, but mostly not. Mostly it’s available right now.” Johnson is the co-author of “Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,” which explores the history of AI as well as other historical technological transformations. “I think AI presents a real opportunity to do something diffe', 'POSITIVE'), ('rent — to run your finance function better, to help your companies invest and make more money [and] make the shareholders happy, and to generate more good jobs,” Johnson said. In their talk, Johnson and Wolk identified four use cases for AI in finance: Artificial intelligence can already be used to streamline kinks in the supply chain across manufacturing, distribution, and delivery. Wolk believes that in the future, AI will help more with prediction. This will be invaluable in health care, he said, where h', 'POSITIVE'), ('aving a responsive supply chain can be “lifesaving.” “Where I’d like to see AI evolve for us is in getting much more into the predictive side of things,” Wolk said. One example: using predictive analytics to identify and anticipate potential disruptions in the supply chain in real time. “We should know when a medical device leaves the supply room from a hospital, or a drug or a biologic leaves the pharmacy [and] needs to be replaced,” he said. “We should know that [in] real time; those are some of the great', 'POSITIVE'), (', great benefits.” Wolk said it’s possible that AI could lower the cost of drug development by improving the chances of matching the right patient with the right clinical trial. In health care, researchers are already using machine learning algorithms to identify existing drugs that might have the potential to treat different diseases. “If you think about what these algorithms can do in a very short period of time relative to where we were just four or five years ago — you’re going to match up and recruit f', 'POSITIVE'), ('or clinical trials with patients who are likely to respond to that type of treatment,” Wolk said. Although the practice is not yet widespread, “I think that’s the potential,” he said. Across different locations, AI is helping J&J stay compliant and better manage its legacy systems by providing better integration and “greater surety on the financial reports that you’re signing off on,” Wolk said. J&J does business in 170 countries worldwide, which can present some compliance challenges, he said, adding, “You', 'POSITIVE'), (' can imagine the different type of accounting that goes on.” AI is helping the company clean up its data and make “great progress around data integrity.” MIT Sloan’s Johnson said that there’s a lot of “really interesting potential” to use technology to augment human capabilities, particularly for workers who don’t have a lot of formal education. He cited joint work at Stanford and MIT that showed that contact center agents with access to a conversational assistant experienced a 14% boost in productivity on ', 'POSITIVE'), ('average, with the largest gains impacting new or low-skilled workers. “Your customer service representatives who are less experienced become better,” Johnson said. “They like their job better. The people that they’re helping are more satisfied, and you get less turnover in those positions.” While hailing the potential benefits of AI, Wolk reiterated his belief that humans will always be crucial to the health care industry. “You can diagnose things [with AI], but unless you have somebody looking over that me', 'POSITIVE'), ('dical chart, something could get missed.” In other words, there is still a lot of progress to be made, Wolk said.

Pfizer's COVID-19-related treatments are broken into two categories: Comirnaty and Paxlovid. In 2022, Pfizer reported total revenue of $100.3 billion -- representing 23% growth year over year and a record for the company. This momentum probably wasn't too surprising, given Pfizer essentially doubled its revenue between 2020 and 2021.

What might be surprising, however, is the precipitous decline of Pfizer's COVID-19 revenue streams. Per Pfizer's third-quarter results, ended Sept. 30, revenue from Comirnaty and Paxlovid decreased 70% and 97%, respectively. To be fair, these drop-off rates should be expected on some level -- given that COVID-19 appears to have subsided from its peak.

There are a couple of reasons why I think Pfizer could be headed for further challenges, though.

Another reason I am bearish on Pfizer revolves around its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen. Per the company's initial 2024 guidance, Seagen is expected to contribute roughly $3.1 billion in revenue to Pfizer this year. However, the company is projecting total sales to be flat year over year. I understand that it can be years before the revenue and cost benefits from acquisitions fully take shape. But with over $30 billion of ", 'NEGATIVE'), ("newly issued debt on the balance sheet to finance the Seagen deal, coupled with the company's declining top line and uninspiring growth prospects, I have some concerns about the business. As of the time of this article, Pfizer trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.9 -- well below the S&P 500's forward P/E of 21.7. While this could be viewed as an opportunity to scoop up shares while expectations are low, I think the discount to the broader market is warranted.

Although this is entirely feasible, I wouldn't be surprised if the integration of Seagen takes longer than anticipated -- thereby causing monetization efforts to stall. Moreover, with its cash cow COVID-19 products falling out of favor, Pfizer is going to need to identify some new catalysts sooner than later.

Now, however, it’s a new year and investors have a chance to buy PFE stock at an absurdly low price.  Whether you’re into value, dividends, or promising turnaround stories, Pfizer should be on your watch list.

Suffice it to say, 2023 wasn’', 'NEGATIVE'), ('t a great year for Pfizer and its loyal shareholders. Pfizer stock slid almost nonstop throughout the year. Furthermore, after many consecutive profitable quarters in which Pfizer beat Wall Street’s consensus EPS estimates, the company posted an unprofitable third quarter of 2023 with an EPS estimate miss. That’s a bitter pill to swallow, no doubt. On the other hand, there are silver linings to be found here. For one thing, after such a painful share-price drawdown, Pfizer’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-', 'NEGATIVE'), ('earnings (P/E) ratio is very reasonable at 15.65x. That’s half of the sector median P/E ratio of 32.94x. Moreover, Pfizer pays a jaw-dropping forward dividend yield of 5.77%, versus the average healthcare sector dividend yield of around 1.5%. Hence, PFE stock should appeal to both value-hunters and passive-income investors. Besides, Pfizer has a packed pipeline outside of obesity drugs. Particularly notable is Pfizer’s oncology division, which grew substantially when the company acquired Seagen. With access', 'POSITIVE'), (' to Seagen’s cancer-fighting assets, Pfizer can boost its revenue-generating potential while also battling life-threatening diseases. It’s commendable that Pfizer is working diligently to fight cancer. However, Pfizer’s management surely knows that the company will also have to compete in the market for obesity drugs. It’s a hot market right now, and Pfizer can’t easily afford to get left behind. Will Pfizer be able to catch up to Ozempic developer Novo Nordisk (NVO:NYSE) in the weight-loss drug category? P', 'POSITIVE'), ('fizer CEO Albert Bourla hasn’t given up hope. “Pfizer’s position is that we believe obesity is a place that we have the ability to play and win. So we will have to play,”\xa0Bourla recently assured. It’s a bold statement, as it won’t be easy for Pfizer to play catch-up with Novo Nordisk in this niche pharmaceutical sector. But then, maybe the pie is big enough for more than one drugmaker to take a big slice. According to Bourla (per Reuters), “some estimates for the eventual size of the obesity market had grow', 'POSITIVE'), ('n to $150 billion a year.” So, if the demand for obesity drugs outstrips the available supply in 2024, there might be room for multiple winners, including Pfizer. Pfizer wasn’t constantly in the headlines last year. However, the company maintained a robust drug pipeline and is now well-positioned to ramp up its battle against cancer. Plus, Pfizer never stopped rewarding its loyal shareholders with generous dividends, and the company might become a strong contender in the market for weight-loss drugs.

The company now expects 2023 sales of $58 billion to $61 billion, down from its previous guidance of $67 billion to $70 billion. Pfizer said it cut its revenue outlook "solely due to its Covid products."

Shares of Pfizer initially dropped in extended trading Friday following the announcement. But Pfizer\'s stock rose about 4% on Monday after the company held an investor call about the revised guidance and cost-cutting plan. "We are in the middle of the Covid fatigue.

Pfizer said it expects revenue from the Covid treatment Paxlovid to come in $7 billion lower than previously anticipated, in part due to the return of doses labeled for emergency use by the U.S. government.

"Given the new realities that Albert just mentioned, we now know that we need t', 'NEGATIVE'), ('o adjust our cost base accordingly," Pfizer CFO Dave Denton said during the Monday investor call, referring to the slump in demand for Covid vaccines and products. Pfizer expects the cost cuts, which will include layoffs, to produce $1 billion in savings this year and at least $2.5 billion in 2024. The company expects to incur approximately $3 billion in one-time costs to launch the program, including severance and implementation expenses. Denton said the program will "touch all parts of the business in all', 'POSITIVE'), (' regions," but he declined to provide additional details on the sources of the cuts. Denton said the cost-cutting initiative will not affect Pfizer\'s plan to acquire cancer test developer Seagen. He said Pfizer still expects the transaction to close later this year or early in 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
