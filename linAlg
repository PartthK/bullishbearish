To determine whether a set is a vector space, we need to check if it satisfies all the vector space axioms, including closure under addition and scalar multiplication. Let's analyze each set based on these criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The set of all integers \( \mathbb{Z} = \{ \dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots \} \)\\
    This set is \textbf{not} a vector space. One of the reasons is that it is not closed under scalar multiplication. \\
    For example, consider the scalar \( \frac{1}{2} \) (which is a real number) and an integer from the set, say \( 2 \). Scalar multiplication yields \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 1 \), which is an integer and still in the set. However, if we take \( 1 \) and multiply it by \( \frac{1}{2} \), we get \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2} \), which is not an integer and thus not in the set. This example violates the axiom of closure under scalar multiplication.

    \item The set of all polynomials \( p(x) \) satisfying \( p(0) = 1 \)\\
    This set is \textbf{not} a vector space. It is not closed under addition. \\
    For instance, let's take two polynomials in the set, \( p_1(x) = 1 + x \) and \( p_2(x) = 1 - x \). Both satisfy \( p(0) = 1 \). However, if we add these two polynomials, we get \( p_1(x) + p_2(x) = (1 + x) + (1 - x) = 2 \). The resulting polynomial, \( p(x) = 2 \), does not satisfy \( p(0) = 1 \) (since \( p(0) = 2 \)), and thus it is not in the set. This example shows the failure of closure under addition.

    \item The set of all points \( (x, y) \) in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) that lie on the line \( x + y = 0 \)\\
    This set is a vector space. The line \( x + y = 0 \) can be rewritten as \( y = -x \), representing all scalar multiples of the vector \( (1, -1) \). \\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Closure under addition}: If \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are any two points on the line, then \( x_1 + y_1 = 0 \) and \( x_2 + y_2 = 0 \). Adding these points gives \( (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2) \), and since \( x_1 + x_2 + y_1 + y_2 = 0 + 0 = 0 \), the sum is also on the line.
        \item \textbf{Closure under scalar multiplication}: For any scalar \( k \) and any point \( (x, y) \) on the line, scalar multiplication gives \( k(x, y) = (kx, ky) \). Since \( x + y = 0 \), we also have \( kx + ky = k(x + y) = k \cdot 0 = 0 \), so the result is still on the line.
    \end{itemize}
    Therefore, among the given sets, only the set of points on the line \( x + y = 0 \) in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) is a vector space.
\end{enumerate}
