Problem 7. [3 points] Which of the following sets are vector spaces?
1. The set of all integers Z = {· · · , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, · · · }.
2. The set of all polynomials p(x) satisfying p(0) = 1.
3. The set of all points (x, y) ∈ R
2
that lie on the line x + y = 0.
For those that are not vector spaces, give concrete examples of one of the vector space axioms
failing. For those that are vector spaces, give a justification for why the set is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.
